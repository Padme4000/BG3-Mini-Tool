# BG3 Mini Tool

A tool I am creating to make editing these files a less of a strain on the eyes that I want to share with others.

This is a very WIP tool and I am only one person who is learning how to code as I make this tool. I use books I bought, internet tutorials as well as help from ChatGPT, it helped me work out the exact math required to properly assign version numbers from the int64 that will show correctly in bg3 mod manager. I have autism and social phobia so asking a bot what I might have done wrong or for maths is very much an accessibility thing for me.

It may also be slow going as the game is being released 3rd of August. If we don't get an official tool to edit these files I will continue my work on it, but please bare in mind I will need to update my own mods, and time to play the game. So there could also be slow updates in between versions, as I have more than a few hobbies. However I hope each version will help someone.

This tool won't be made for everything. I can only make it work for things I know how to make. 

Things already included:
- create a new meta.lsx
- New Head/Horn slots
- folder creation for lsx locations
- Colour wheel that shows Hex and converts it also to sRGB 0 to 1.0 converter
- separate version number generator in the tools tab with the colour wheel

Things I hope to include:
- New Hairs slots
- New Beards slots
- New Hair Colours (Main, Greying and Highlights)
- New Makeup Colours
- New Tattoo Colours
- New Eye Colours
- Editing certain NPC's such as companions

What it may end up including:
- New Armours, Helmets, Clothing and such
  - I am still new to this so it may take much longer to setup
- create new races
  - not made one yet, I do plan to try so this may get added in the future


What this tool won't do: 
- It will not edit pre-existing files.
  - what this means is that the files you edit in this tool are new. 
   - The tool can add some things to pre-existing files but as of right now it will not load and edit pre-existing files
- it will not create mesh files for you 
- it won't edit files for creating new spells etc
