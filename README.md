# BG3 Mini Tool

A tool I am creating to make editing these files a less of a strain on the eyes that I want to share with others.

This is a very WIP tool and I am only one person who is learning how to code as I make this tool. I use books I bought, internet tutorials and at the beginning of the tool help from ChatGPT, it helped me work out the exact math required to properly assign version numbers from the int64 that will show correctly in bg3 mod manager. I have autism and social phobia so asking a bot what I might have done wrong for the maths was very much an accessibility thing for me.

However having said that, I have stopped using it. Instead I have bought more books and even started online courses to help learn the bits I struggle on. I refuse to add to the damage GenAI/AI Chatbots are doing.

As of the toolkit release, this tool will only be updated to fix any bugs anyone finds.

Things already included:
- create a new meta.lsx
- New Head/Horn/Hair slots
- folder creation for lsx locations
- Colour wheel that shows Hex and converts it also to sRGB 0 to 1.0 converter
- separate version number generator in the tools tab with the colour wheel with a save as option to save to existing meta's
- mass replace uuids/handles (always save a copy of your mod elsewhere just as a precaution like when using any other tools)
- localisation editor
- creating 32 entries for CCAV (or more if the CharacterCreationAppearanceVisuals_ForAll.lsx is added to add more between the <children></children>
- adding vfx files for heads to fix speak with the dead and such not working
