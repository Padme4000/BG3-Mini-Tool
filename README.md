# BG3 Mini Tool

A tool I am creating to make editing these files a less of a strain on the eyes that I want to share with others.

This is a very WIP tool and I am only one person who has bare minimum coding knowledge. I am learning as I make this tool.

It may also be slow going as the game is being released 3rd of August. If we don't get an official tool to edit these files I will continue my work on it, but please bare in mind I will need to update my own mods, and time to play the game. So there could also be slow updates in between versions, as I have more than a few hobbies. However I hope each version will help someone.

This tool won't be made for everything. I can only make it work for things I know how to make. 

Things already included:
- create a new meta.lsx
- New Head/Horn slots
- folder creation for lsx locations
- Colour wheel that shows Hex and converts it also to sRGB 0 to 1.0 converter
- separate version number generator in the tools tab with the colour wheel

Things I plan to include:
- New Hairs slots
- New Beards slots
- New Hair Colours (Main, Greying and Highlights)
- New Makeup Colours
- New Tattoo Colours
- New Eye Colours
- Editing certain NPC's such as companions

What it may end up including:
- New Armours, Helmets, Clothing and such
  - I am still new to this so it may take much longer to setup
- create new races
  - not made one yet, I do plan to try so this may get added in the future


What this tool won't do: 
- It will not edit pre-existing files.
  - what this means is that the files you edit in this tool are new. 
   - The tool can add some things to pre-existing files but as of right now it will not load and edit pre-existing files
- it will not create mesh files for you 
- it won't edit files for creating new spells etc
